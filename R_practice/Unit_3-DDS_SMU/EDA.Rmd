#EDA is about looking for what we believe to be there, as well as what we do not expect to be there

## Plots
# Histograms
# Box plots
# Density plots
# Pairwise scatter
# Time series

## Summary Stats
# Mean
# Five number summary

## Why do EDA?
# Gain knowledge about our data
# Comparisons between dists
# Sanity check
# Missing data
# Outliers
# Summarize data

## How to EDA?
# Ask questions about data
# Questions will lead to newer and more fruitful questions
# Use plots, graphs, summary stats to answer those questions
# Two main questions drive EDA:
# - What type of dist do my vars follow?
# - What type of covariation occurs between my variables?
