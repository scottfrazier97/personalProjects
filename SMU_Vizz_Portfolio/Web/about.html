        <p id="about-info">Having graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas's Criminology program in May 2020, I have garnered many skills that revolve around the analysis, and manipulation of data. With the job market becoming very competitive after the COVID-19 outbreak, 
            I decided it was time to acquire marketable skills to broaden his potential job opportunities. After doing some research, I decided to focus on an entirely new skill-set, which ultimately ended up being data science. 
            In September of 2020, I enrolled in the Data Science Bootcamp at Southern Methodist University; where I learned how to gather, manipulate, and present large quantities of data. To accomplish this, I learned how to use a variety of different technologies that are used heavily in the data science industry today.</p>
